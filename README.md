## What is this?

On the HanselMinutes [podcast](https://hanselminutes.com/586/you-should-write-an-interpreter-with-thorsten-ball),
I heard about a self-published book called ["Writing an Interpreter in Go"](https://interpreterbook.com/)
by Thorsten Ball. I've been looking for an excuse to learn Go, and this seemed perfect.

This repo contains my efforts to follow along and build the interpreter
described in the book.
