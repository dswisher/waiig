## What is this?

On the HanselMinutes [podcast](https://hanselminutes.com/586/you-should-write-an-interpreter-with-thorsten-ball),
I heard about a self-published book called
["Writing an Interpreter in Go"](https://smile.amazon.com/Writing-Interpreter-Go-Thorsten-Ball-ebook/dp/B01N2T1VD2)
by [Thorsten Ball](https://thorstenball.com/). I've been looking for an excuse to learn Go, and this seemed perfect.

This repo contains my efforts to follow along and build the interpreter
described in the book.
